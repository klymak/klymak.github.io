I am responsible for organising Economics for PPE and History & Economics at Somerville College, University of Oxford. I am also a Tutor for Quantitative Economics, Development Economics and Introductory Economics. 


Prior to that I have been convening and lecturing the Quantitative Methods course for the MSc Economics for Development at the University of Oxford. The course was co-taught with Simon Quinn, Christopher Woodruff and Abigail Adams-Prassl. Topics we have covered include cross-sectional regression, Maximum Likelihood, the linear probability model and probit and logit models, (dynamic) panel data estimators, difference-in-differences, instrumental variable estimation, RCTs, non-parametric methods, treatment effects and machine learning.


During my PhD at Trinity College Dublin, I taught undergraduate Econometrics for three years. I received the Dermot McAleese Teaching Award in 2017. I also taught Introduction to Economics at Trinity College Dublin. 


I taught Statistics and Econometrics for summer/short courses hosted by the CSAE, TIME and DSAI.
